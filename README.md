# WhimsyChat
- WhimsyChat is a custom transformer model built by me using a dataset of 1 million characters and featuring 5 million trainable parameters.
- This decoder-only model generates hilarious content between personas of itself. You give it context, and it continues to augment data to those words.
- Users can also include token count, a measure that tells the model how many tokens to generate. 
- The project includes a beautiful interactive frontend. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the application.
